## Verification Log
| Date (UTC) | Owner | Summary | Coverage / Follow-ups |
|------------|-------|---------|------------------------|
| 2025-09-28 | Codex | Added idempotent handling for synthetic auth-bypass user creation, hardened product URL primary toggling, and exposed multi-URL management + slug cleanup in the admin UI. | `uv run pytest --cov` (95%), `uv run mypy .`, `uv run ruff check`, `npm run test -- tests/views/ProductsView.test.ts` & `tests/stores/useProductsStore.test.ts`. Confirm docker stack restart helper to be rehearsed separately. |
